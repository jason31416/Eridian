# Eridian
This repository is for my school project

## What is it?
Eridian is a language that the alien in Project Hail Mary speaks. The Eridian alphabet is absolute pitch itself, without any tone. The alphabet consists of chords of notes since Eridians have the ability to "pronounce" multiple notes at once. Somehow it occupies similar frequencies with human language, and the reason is explained by the author himself in the book: “Sound of an object touching object very important. Evolve to hear”. Also, Eridian has a different number system, which will be explained in detail in the rest of the poster. In conclusion, this type of language is scientifically possible but currently doesn’t exist in any known intelligence species.

## What is this code?
The language itself includes multiple pitches at the same time, which can be easily separated by the computer using a mathematical algorithm named “Fourier transform”. After he separated the notes, he can look up the corresponding English word using a simple look-up table. This way, he can create a translation application to help his communication with Rocky. However, since Rocky is extremely good at calculating and memorizing, he can perform the above algorithms in his brain.
This repository contains a code that can translate languages similar to Eridian.
(Note that since the book didn't include any infomation about what exactly does a pitch means in English, I have to randomly generate a dictionary)
